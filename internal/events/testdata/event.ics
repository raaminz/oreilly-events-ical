SUMMARY:Fundamentals of Learning: Learn faster and better using neuroscience [O’Reilly Live Event]
DESCRIPTION:Many of us feel overwhelmed by the sheer amount of knowledge— and disinformation— we face daily. Currently there are over a dozen theories about how best to learn\, suggesting that the complexity of the brain coupled with human variability have made this a challenging field. However\, the field of learning-science offers some major findings about how the brain learns\, some of them counterintuitive. It seems we’ve been wasting a lot of time on learning! In this course we’ll tackle three areas: In the first hour\, mapping what you want to learn to two major methods\; in the second hour\, ways to locate the best-supported information\; and in the third hour\, ways to evaluate the information. There will be throughout a great deal of group chat.\n\nAPAC friendly time.\n\nWith Connie Missimer\n\nClick to view the full event details or join when the event is in session: https://learning.oreilly.com/live-events/-/0636920064594/0642572014257/?utm_medium=calendar&utm_source=schedule%2Breminder&utm_campaign=calendar%2Bapple&utm_content=fundamentals-of-learning-learn-faster-and-better-using-neuroscience \n\n
